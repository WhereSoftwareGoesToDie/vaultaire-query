# vaultaire-query [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anchor/vaultaire-query.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anchor/vaultaire-query)

This package provides:

  * ``Query``: a whole exciting new type synonym for ``pipes``'s ``ListT``, so you can build up queries list-comprehension style.
  * Some basic combinators for manipulating queries
  * ``vaultaire``-specific queries
  * Connection layers to add vaultaire users such as ``marquise`` as a backend for ``vaultaire-query``
